            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Baked camembert. In this recipe, we will use rosemary, garlic and olive oil to flavour the cheese, which will give us a rich and tangy taste, balanced out with good old fashion breadsticks.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>300g Premium Camembert</li>
                <li>2 tbsp of Olive Oil</li>
                <li>1 Sprig of Rosemary, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>2 Cloves of Garlic, sliced</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat your oven to 190*C</li>
                <li>Remove the packaging from your camembert, then place the bare cheese back inside the wooden box with the top open.</li>
                <li>Score two sets of 4-5 intersecting lines into the top rind of the cheese.</li>
                <li>Begin pushing slices of garlic into the middle layer of the cheese, using the score marks that we just created.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some rosemary on top of the cheese.</li>
                <li>Pour the olive oil over the top of the cheese.</li>
                <li>Place into the oven for 12-15mins. I like to keep the lid on to start with, before removing it halfway through to allow for partial browning on top.</li>
                <li>Leave to stand for 1-2min(s).</li>
                <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
            </ol>
